Description: iSCSI initiator tools
 The Open-iSCSI project is a high-performance, transport independent,
 multi-platform implementation of RFC3720 iSCSI.
 .
 Open-iSCSI is partitioned into user and kernel parts.
 .
 The kernel portion of Open-iSCSI is a from-scratch code
 licensed under GPL. The kernel part implements iSCSI data path
 (that is, iSCSI Read and iSCSI Write), and consists of three
 loadable modules: scsi_transport_iscsi.ko, libiscsi.ko and iscsi_tcp.ko.
 .
 User space contains the entire control plane: configuration
 manager, iSCSI Discovery, Login and Logout processing,
 connection-level error processing, Nop-In and Nop-Out handling,
 and (in the future:) Text processing, iSNS, SLP, Radius, etc.
 .
 The user space Open-iSCSI consists of a daemon process called
 iscsid, and a management utility iscsiadm.
 .
 This package includes a daemon, iscsid, and a management utility,
 iscsiadm.

Description: iSCSI offloading daemon for QLogic devices
 The Open-iSCSI project is a high-performance, transport independent,
 multi-platform implementation of RFC3720 iSCSI.
 .
 This tool is to be used in conjunction with the QLogic NetXtreme II Linux
 driver (Kernel module name: 'bnx2' and 'bnx2x'), QLogic CNIC driver,
 and the QLogic iSCSI driver (Kernel module name: 'bnx2i').
 .
 This user space tool is used in conjunction with the following
 QLogic Network Controllers:
   bnx2:  BCM5706, BCM5708, BCM5709 devices
   bnx2x: BCM57710, BCM57711, BCM57711E, BCM57712, BCM57712E,
          BCM57800, BCM57810, BCM57840 devices
 .
 This utility will provide the ARP and DHCP functionality for the iSCSI
 offload. The communication to the driver is done via Userspace I/O (Kernel
 module name 'uio').
 .
 This package is required to offload iSCSI onto these devices.

# Note: the (virtual) udeb package scsi-modules (provided by different
#       linux kernel udebs) must exist for these architectures - so
#       check that before adding them to this list; the other
#       scsi-(core|common|...)-modules are NOT sufficient!
